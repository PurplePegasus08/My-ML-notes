Basics of Probability:

Explaing what are these Random Experiment, Trial, Outcomes, Sample Space and Eventg

Random Experiment: Tossing a coin.

Trial: Each time you toss the coin.

Outcomes: The results can be either Heads (H) or Tails (T).

Sample Space (S): The set of all possible outcomes, which is {H, T}.

Event (E): If we're interested in getting a Head, then the event is {H}. If we're interested in getting a Tail, then the event is {T}.



Types of Events in Probability: Definitions

1. Simple Event:
A simple event consists of exactly one outcome.

2. Compound Event:
A compound event consists of two or more simple events.

3. Certain Event:
A certain event is an event that is sure to happen. Its probability is 1.

4. Impossible Event:
An impossible event is an event that cannot happen. Its probability is 0.

5. Mutually Exclusive Events:
Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot happen at the same time.

6. Exhaustive Events:
Events are exhaustive if they cover all possible outcomes of a random experiment.

7. Independent Events:
Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other.

8. Dependent Events:
Two events are dependent if the occurrence of one affects the occurrence of the other.

9. Complementary Events:
The complement of an event A is the event that A does not occur.
