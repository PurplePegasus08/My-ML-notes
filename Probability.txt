Basics of Probability:

Explaing what are these Random Experiment, Trial, Outcomes, Sample Space and Eventg

Random Experiment: Tossing a coin.

Trial: Each time you toss the coin.

Outcomes: The results can be either Heads (H) or Tails (T).

Sample Space (S): The set of all possible outcomes, which is {H, T}.

Event (E): If we're interested in getting a Head, then the event is {H}. If we're interested in getting a Tail, then the event is {T}.
